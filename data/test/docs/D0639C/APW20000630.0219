   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- High-ranking officials were not
immediately notified and alarms were ignored during a tiny leak of
dangerous nerve gas at the Army's chemical-weapons incinerator in
May, according to a report by the plant's operators.


   The report from Army contractor EG&AMP;G Defense Materials Inc.
blamed the leak in Tooele, Utah, on a chain of events that began
when debris jammed the feed chute of a rocket kiln.


   The report said an inexperienced operator flushed the kiln with
too much air, pushing unburned nerve gas out an emissions stack.


   The report also said a supervisor was preoccupied with
administrative work, higher officials were uninformed about the
leak and warnings were ignored because of a history of false
alarms.


   The state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
have said the leak -- the size of a drop -- wasn't dangerous, but the
plant remains shut down for investigation.


   EG&AMP;G's general manager, Michael J. Rowe, said much of the plant
-- except for the problem furnace -- should be running again by
mid-July.


   The Tooele incinerator helps the government comply with a 1985
law that requires the destruction of deadly chemical agents --
including nerve gas, mustard gas and VX gas -- once part of the
military arsenal.
