	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan signed a global land mine treaty
Saturday, joining 127 other countries that have endorsed the pact,
which prohibits the use, production and stockpiling of the weapon.
	   The announcement was made by Queen Noor, King Hussein's
American-born wife.
	   ``I would like to begin by announcing with great pride and hope
that, as of this morning, the Jordanian Cabinet approved the
signing of the Ottawa convention,'' Noor told more than 250 people
from more than 20 countries at a conference on land mines.
	   Delegates at the two-day meeting are discussing ways of
assisting mine victims in the Middle East. It is hosted by the
Landmine Survivors Network, a private organization based in
Washington, D.C.
	   The Ottawa convention, which was reached in Canada last
December, has been signed by 127 nations. Twenty-three nations have
so far ratified the treaty, which must be ratified by 40 states to
take effect. It prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and
transferring of anti-personnel land mines.
