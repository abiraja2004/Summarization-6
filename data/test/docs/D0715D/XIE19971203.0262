KIEV, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine will not be among the
first batch to sign the Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines,
the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry announced today.


A ministry spokesman told a news briefing that Ukraine rejected
the signing because the destruction of anti-personnel weapons
needed a large amount of money and Ukraine could not afford the
financial burden.


The spokesman did not rule out a possible signing in the future.


A three-day conference on the land mines ban is being held in
Ottawa, Canada, and most of the participating countries are
expected to sign the treaty.


Under the pact, signatories will be required to destroy their
reserves of land mines within four years.


The spokesman said Ukraine stopped manufacturing mines and had
suspended mine exports since 1995.
