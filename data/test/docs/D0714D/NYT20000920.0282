   Putting a crimp in the recording industry's war against
Napster.com, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford
University, and other top schools have refused a request to filter
the music-swapping site from their computer networks.


   Harvard University officials are expected to announce next week
that they, too, will not block access to Napster.


   A lawyer for the rock band Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre
asked several elite colleges this month to ban Napster, which
allows visitors to its Web site to obtain copyrighted music for
free. Not doing so, argued the lawyer, Howard E. King, would make a
college ``an enabler of the theft of intellectual property.''


   But campuses that turned down King's request said the need for
free use of the Internet and the principle of academic freedom are
more important than the threat of copyright infringement.


   ``MIT has a long history of providing its faculty, staff, and
students with uncensored access to the Internet,'' said James D.
Bruce, MIT's vice president for information systems, in a letter to
King.


   Several small institutions, including Amherst and Smith
colleges, are blocking Napster on their computer networks this fall
because so many people on campus were clogging up the Internet
systems as they downloaded music from Napster's huge catalog of
recordings.


   Napster is slated to go before a federal appeals court next
month in a case brought by representatives of the entertainment
industry. The lawsuit charges Napster with violating the rights of
recording artists whose songs are traded freely on the site.


   Opponents of Napster had hoped to recruit more high-profile
schools to lead a nationwide boycott against the site. But Debra
Zumwalt, Stanford's general counsel, said the university resisted
because Napster in some instances can be used legally and for
academic purposes, such as in a class focused on copyright issues.


   ``It's a slippery slope _ once you start banning access to Web
sites because people can potentially violate copyright laws, where
do you stop?'' Zumwalt said.
