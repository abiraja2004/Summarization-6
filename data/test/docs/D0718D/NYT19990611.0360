   SEATTLE _ Basketball legend Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson and
Starbucks boss Howard Schultz brought their inner-city road show to
Seattle's Columbia City neighborhood Friday.


   They opened the latest in their 50-50 joint-venture Starbucks
Coffee stores and Johnson said there will be more in Seattle, along
with one of Johnson's multiplex movie theaters.


   Schultz's Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co. and Johnson's Los
Angeles-based Johnson Development Corp. have recently opened
similar Starbucks coffee stores in West Los Angeles and New York's
Harlem.


   More than 200 residents of the South Seattle Columbia City
community turned out to catch a glimpse of the retired National
Basketball Association superstar who became a top-flight business
executive.


   ``I saw him on TV playing with Michael Jordan in the Olympics,''
said Michael Davis, 6.


   His mom, Sheree Davis, brought Michael and his stepbrother,
Forrest Britt, 5, to the store at the corner of Rainier Avenue
South and South Edmunds Street to see Johnson and, perhaps pick up
his autograph.


   ``I think this will mean jobs for the neighborhood and will help
other businesses come in and help the area become stable,'' she
said.


   Johnson and Schultz said that along with making a profit, a
major goal of their venture is helping the community by showing
other companies that it is good business to bring services to inner
cities.


   ``I think there is a balance at what business can be and it's
not only to show a profit but to show some benevolence and give
back,'' Schultz said. ``We hope other national retailers will come
in.''


   Johnson said giving pride to the community, bringing ``a first
class'' retailer and supplying jobs are among his goals.


   ``We feel the community here deserves this,'' Johnson said. ``We
want what everybody else wants and that's the best of the best _
and today you have the best.''


   Johnson said that the millions of dollars he earned during his
13-year professional basketball career financed his businesses and
insisted he runs his five-company empire.


   ``I'm a hands-on boss,'' he said. ``I go over the numbers every
day.''


   His businesses include movie theaters, a retail mall, television
and children's multimedia production companies, a concert and
boxing promotion company, a record label and controlling interest
in a Los Angeles bank.


   Brenda Johnson, a Columbia City resident, agreed that bringing
the Starbucks store to the neighborhood could bring jobs and other
benefits.


   ``I hope it will bring more businesses into Columbia City,'' she
said.


   Not everyone welcomed the new Starbucks store, however.


   Outside, a man passed out leaflets charging Starbucks ``exploits
prison labor.'' A Starbucks spokeswoman said she knew nothing about
the charges and couldn't respond.


   A block south, at the year-old Lottie Motts Espresso Shop,
Autumn Eaton paused between making lattes to say she is
``disappointed'' that Starbucks will be a competitor.


   Schultz earlier said that Starbucks stores ``enlarge the
coffee-drinking community and there is usually enough business for
all.''


   ``It's too early to tell what the effect will be here,'' Eaton
said.
