   UNDATED - CNN is like a 24-hour record store: You don't require
its services all the time, but it's nice to know it's there if you
need it.


   The network George Bush watched during the Persian Gulf War
celebrates 20 years today - 20 years of all news, all the time -
even when there's no news to report.


   We've talked before about the kinds of problems this presents.
When other networks, such as MSNBC and Fox News, jumped into the
24-hour fray, competition somehow bred idiocy - turning the Elian
Gonzales story into a Huge Event, for instance, fueling the
frustrations both sides felt until a firecracker became a powder
keg.


   Yet when gun-toting feds finally burst into the home where Elian
was staying, it sure was nice to have the 24-hour guys around so we
could see what was happening. So, like anything else, 24-hour news
is a trade-off; the best you can hope for is that the good
outweighs the bad. And with CNN, it usually does.


   When the space shuttle Challenger exploded, we were glued to the
set. When Bernard Shaw, John Holliman and Peter Arnett crawled
underneath a table in Baghdad and kept reporting as the city was
being bombed, people of my generation got a taste of what hearing
World War II radio broadcasts was like.


   On the downside, CNN has given us ``Larry King Live'' and
``Crossfire,'' a big honkin' loogie in the eye of the traditional
interview show and news-talk roundtable, respectively.


   But with local TV news being nothing more than a police lineup
broken up with the occasional weather gimmick, it's good to have an
option when national news breaks.


   And when there's nothing going on? That's why ``MASH'' reruns
exist.


   VH1 has scheduled a movie each Wednesday night through Sept. 6,
including five original films, the first of which, ``It's Only Rock
and'' ``Roll,'' aired Wednesday. The rest: ``Daydream Believers:
The Monkees'' ``Story,'' on June 28 and repeating Aug. 2; ``Out of
Sync,'' on July 12; ``Meatloaf: Bat Out of Hell'' on July 26; and
``At Any Cost,'' on Aug. 9.


   Great, I guess. But between this and MTV's insipid programming,
where does a guy got to go to see a music video these days?
