   TRENTON, Ohio _ In a time when the nation's public schools are
devoid of organized prayer, millions of students, teachers and
parents bowed their heads Wednesday morning commemorating the
annual ``See You at the Pole.''


   In Trenton, more than 30 students, teachers and parents gathered
at a flagpole outside of Edgewood High School to pray for spiritual
guidance.


   Generation X-ers put aside their backpacks and joined hands with
their parents and teachers to make a ``visible (religious) stand''
just before the start of the school day.


   The group prayed for classmates, faculty and teachers as well as
for the well-being of the nation and a ``safe school year.''


   Freshman Billy McClure said he attended the event ``to help
everybody be a witness for God.``


   ``Without prayer you don't get anywhere. You got to pray
everyday to keep you strong,'' McClure said.


   Senior Janet Tannreuther said she attended in protest of new
legislation that bans open religious expression during
extracurricular activities including sporting events.


   ``(I came) to pray with my fellow students because they took
away our right to pray at the football games,'' Tannreuther said.
``I thought that was wrong.''


   ``This event allows us to keep (children) focused upon God,''
said her brother Chris Tannreuther, standing a few feet away. ``He
is the answer to all of our problems.''


   Government teacher and parent Mike Mignery said the event
allowed him to reflect upon legislative laws and freedom of
expression.


   ``You have the right to freely practice your faith. That is the
foremost amendment in the Bill of Rights. I think it's important
for us to do that here at school. This is lawful. This is what the
courts say we are allowed to do,'' Mignery said. ``I think the
reason we are losing many of our rights is because may of us aren't
exercising our rights today.''


   According to the ``See You at the Pole'' Website, the event
draws more than 3 million participants each year. The site said the
event is student initiated and came out of the desire of `` a small
group of teen-agers'' from Burleson, Texas, in 1990.
