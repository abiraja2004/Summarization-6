   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ Generation X consumers prefer compact and
premium midsize vehicles, with their No. 1 choice being the Honda
Civic, according to a report released Tuesday by Agoura Hills-based
J.D. Power and Associates.


   But that 20- to 34-year-old group is a highly fragmented lot
and, thus, a tough bunch to market to _ which is something
carmakers are going to have to learn to do, as this group is
expected to constitute one-quarter to one-third of the car-buying
public by 2005, the study said.


   Also, the study found that older Gen-Xers rely on the Internet
to obtain information before buying a car much more frequently than
do 20- to 24-year-olds, who have less access to the Internet, are
first-time buyers and tend to turn to family and friends for input.


   ``One other interesting finding is that Generation X is more
willing to stretch its income to buy a vehicle,'' said Sara Wong
Hilton, manager of market analysis at Power's Detroit office, who
led the study.


   Gen-Xers will pay about 46 percent of their annual household
income on a new vehicle, vs. 35 percent for baby boomers.


   Lynda Sakamaki-Smith, spokeswoman for American Honda Motor Co.
Inc., said she wasn't surprised to hear that Honda models are among
Gen-Xers' favorites. The company has sold 129,531 1999 Civics
through May, and the median age is 28 for the sportier coupe model.


   About half the Civic buyers are single; 46.5 percent are male,
53.5 percent are female; and 55 percent are college graduates or
higher, spokeswoman Sakamaki-Smith said.


   ``This Generation X group sees (the Civic's) potential for fun,
but it's reliable at the same time,'' she said.
