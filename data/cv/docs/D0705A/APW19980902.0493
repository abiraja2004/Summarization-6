	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist movement ETA
accused the Spanish government Wednesday of trying to snuff out the
Basque language.
	   The charge came in a statement published in a radical newspaper,
Euskadi Informacion. In the Basque language, known as Euskera,
Euskadi is the word for the Basque country, a region straddling the
border between Spain and France.
	   ETA took issue with ``enemies of Euskera who do not have the
right to live in Euskadi.''
	   It said the governments and Spain and France were trying to
``close off the language and force it into a ghetto to be
eliminated little by little.''
	   ``France and Spain are maintaining their imperialism,'' the
statement said.
	   Euskadi Informacion is a makeshift publication that surfaced
after the daily Egin was shut down in July over its alleged links
to ETA.
	   An estimated 600,000 people speak Euskera in the seven Basque
provinces in Spain and France, according to the University of the
Basque Country, in San Sebastian.
	   It was among regional languages that were officially banned
under the dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco from 1939 to 1975.
	   ETA, an acronym that stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
killed almost 800 people in a 30-year fight for independence in the
Basque country of northern Spain.
