   QUESTION: My 9-year-old son is in the gifted and talented
program at school. Though he excels in music and arts and his
intelligence level is way beyond his years, he is easily
frustrated, cries frequently and does not do what he is told.


   His teachers call me all the time, telling me he is a discipline
problem and will not finish his work. He also does not seem to get
along with other children and is very unorganized.


   Could he be ADHD _ even though he makes straight A's when he
chooses to do his work? _ R.H., Guilford, Ind.


   DR. BRAZELTON: The diagnosis of ADHD _ Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder _ doesn't occur to me. Too many adults
(teachers and parents) use it as a sort of wastebasket diagnosis.


   Instead, I would think that your son is feeling too much
pressure to perform. He may be a perfectionist and may not want to
take chances on being anything but perfect.


   The gifted program may be too pressured an environment for an
already inner-pressured child. Hearing that other children shun him
and that he is disorganized worries me. I urge you to have your son
evaluated by a child psychologist or therapist. It sounds as if he
may be feeling overwhelmed or depressed.


   QUESTION: Our 26-month-old son is very loving and well-behaved,
but when he gets mad or frustrated he acts out by hitting, kicking
or throwing things.


   What would you suggest we do? When we put him in timeout, he
gets frantic and more out of control _ not calmer. _ R.H., Missouri
City, Texas


   DR. BRAZELTON: His out-of-control, hurting behaviors are a mark
of how frightening it is to lose control. He needs you to help him
regain control and to help him understand his behavior.


   Hold him or contain him when he gets out of control (a timeout
is just for that purpose). As soon as you break the cycle, tell him
that you understand how upset he is but that you also want to help
him learn to control himself.


   It's too frightening to everyone (including him) when he loses
it.


   QUESTION: When my 4-year-old son wakes up at night, he comes
into our bed, saying he is afraid. We welcome him with open arms
and do not take him back to his bed. My question: By allowing him
to come into our bed, are we preventing him from learning to
overcome his fears and anxieties? Or is he learning a sense of
love, security and self-importance from us? _ M.J.M., Boca Raton,
Fla.


   DR. BRAZELTON: Both. You are certainly offering him security by
accepting him. But you aren't helping him overcome his
age-appropriate fears and nightmares. These are normal at his age,
when he is learning about his own aggressive feelings.


   During the day, he will need your help with those fears and your
understanding. He will best learn how to handle angry and
aggressive feelings from you and your spouse by modeling on you
both as you handle your own feelings.


   I won't tell you when to begin helping him go back to his own
bed, but it should be a goal. He'd be proud if he could learn to
handle his own fears.


   QUESTION: I am very upset about my 4 1/2-year-old grandson. He
is a bright, happy, verbal youngster at home. However, in
daycare/nursery school, he will not speak with the children or
teacher. This has been the problem since he started daycare at 2
1/2.


   His parents have been going with him to therapy for 16 months _
with two different therapists. He still won't speak in school,
though he participates in all activities.


   What are your thoughts? _ R.W., Baltimore, Md.


   DR. BRAZELTON: I assume that his parents have gotten an
evaluation from the therapists about whether your grandson has a
hypersensitive hearing problem or a sensory integration problem,
which can lead to an autistic-like interference in handling complex
environments. If he hasn't been evaluated, he should be.


   But if your grandson is not plagued with such a problem, he may
just be a child who participates visually. I have seen children who
are part of the group without ever participating openly.


   If no one pushes him, he'll probably start communicating on his
own.
