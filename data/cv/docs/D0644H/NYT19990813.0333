   WASHINGTON _ After George Bush lost the presidency to Bill
Clinton in 1992, some Republicans blamed one of their own: Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.


   Greenspan had first become involved in Republican politics
during Richard M. Nixon's 1968 campaign, and he had been a fixture
among the party's economic policy makers ever since.


   He had been appointed Fed chairman by Ronald Reagan and
reappointed by Bush. But in the eyes of Bush's supporters,
Greenspan had committed an unforgivable sin: failing to bring the
economy back to full strength quickly enough after the 1990-91
recession.


   Clinton exploited the lingering economic angst masterfully in
1992, and ever since he has ridden an upturn that in hindsight was
well under way by Election Day.


   All of this is to suggest that Greenspan is by no means
unfamiliar with the rough and tumble of election year politics, or
with the many ways in which the Fed can become an issue. And it is
already clear, nearly 15 months before Election Day, that Greenspan
will figure into this political cycle.


   The first salvos against him have again come not from Democrats
but from Republicans. In Iowa, where the Republicans battling to
stay in the race against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for the
party's presidential nomination have become increasingly desperate
for attention, both Steve Forbes and Dan Quayle have attacked the
Fed and Greenspan for raising interest rates when crop prices are
plunging and farmers are hurting.


   ``Interest rates are too high, and while Alan Greenspan and the
Federal Reserve raise rates, commodity prices have plummeted,''
Forbes says in a 60-second radio spot being run in Iowa. Forbes
goes on to blame monetary policy together with ``bad economic
advice from the Clinton-Gore administration'' for the troubles
plaguing agriculture.


   Populist rage from the farm belt at tight-money bankers is
hardly new; what is a bit confounding is that the present attacks
are coming from the conservative wing of the Republican Party,
Greenspan's ideological home.


   Then again, Greenspan is an easy target for politicians of all
stripes because he never hits back, at least not publicly. Perhaps
more to the point in this case, some Republicans view Greenspan as
having sold out and become all but a member of the Clinton
administration.


   They have watched with some unease over the past six and a half
years as Greenspan became chummy first with former Treasury
Secretary Robert E. Rubin and now with his successor, Lawrence H.
Summers, as well as with Clinton himself. And the party's more
ardent tax cutters were dismayed, if not aghast, when Greenspan
told Congress last month that the nation would be better off using
projected federal budget surpluses for debt reduction than for
reducing taxes.


   Since Clinton has framed the fiscal policy choice just that way
_ his prudent debt reduction plan versus irresponsible Republican
tax cuts _ Greenspan was seen as siding with the Democrats. No one
paid much attention to the Fed chairman's stated preference for tax
cuts over additional government spending, which in the eyes of most
Republicans in Washington is the real choice before the country.


   If Congress and the White House fail to work out a deal in the
next few months on splitting up the surplus, leaving the issue to
be fought out on the campaign trail, Greenspan's name will no doubt
be invoked repeatedly by both parties to bolster their positions.


   While fiscal policy can make for powerful politics, it is just a
sideline for Greenspan. The far more compelling issue for him could
be how high to push interest rates over the next 6 or 12 months if
the economy continues to roar along, setting off inflation alarm
bells.


   Politically, it will be a tough call; Greenspan would no doubt
prefer to avoid raising rates during a presidential campaign.


   Economically, it could prove even trickier, since Greenspan is
still wrestling with the degree to which this technology-driven,
financial-market-centric, globally oriented economy can hold off
inflation.


   Besides a dozen years' experience on the job and a tough skin,
the Fed chairman has something else going for him. If there were a
Bush family grudge against him, it has been put aside, and Governor
Bush has sent clear signals that he would support Greenspan's
reappointment next year to a fourth four-year term. Vice President
Al Gore has been equally supportive.


   With that bipartisan support, Greenspan has considerable leeway
in formulating policy, as well as an opportunity to push ahead with
his slow but steady efforts to make the Fed more open in the way it
considers and communicates its interest-rate decisions.


   In the end, demystifying the institution and making clear that
the rapidly changing economy is sometimes as difficult to read from
within the Fed as from without could prove the best insulation
against political attacks.
