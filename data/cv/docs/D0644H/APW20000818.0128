   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal treasury posted a surplus of $4.76
billion in July, smaller than June's $56.3 billion surplus but a
rare feat since July usually is marked by a budget deficit.


   The government's surplus last month, announced by the Treasury
Department on Friday, compared with a $25.2 billion deficit in July
1999.


   It was the first time the government posted a surplus in July
since the 1950s.


   The budget is on track to produce a record bounty for the entire
fiscal year.


   Revenue for July totaled $134.1 billion, while expenditures came
to $129.3 billion.


   For the first 10 months of fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1, the
government is running a surplus of $181 billion -- far surpassing
the record $124.4 billion surplus for all of fiscal year 1999.


   Revenue for the first nine months came to $1.67 trillion, while
spending totaled $1.49 trillion.


   With the expected surplus for fiscal year 2000, it would be the
first time the government has reported three consecutive surplus
years since 1947, 1948 and 1949.


   The Clinton administration is predicting a $224 billion surplus
for fiscal 2000, while the Congressional Budget Office is
projecting a slightly larger $232 billion.
