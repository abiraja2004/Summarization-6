   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's top campaign strategist
defended the Republican presidential frontrunner's controversial
decision to snub leaders of a gay GOP group, asserting Wednesday
that the Log Cabin Republicans have been critical of Bush on
several issues.


   The strategist, Karl Rove, said the group's leaders have asked
for meetings with Bush ``with the stated purpose of coming in and
explaining why Governor Bush is wrong on gay adoption or why he is
wrong on broadening the Texas hate-crimes bill'' to protect gays
against attacks based on their sexual orientation.


   Rove, who is based in Austin, Texas, added in a meeting with
reporters here that ``the national office of the Log Cabin
Republicans has been critical of Bush and is in fact doing a
fund-raiser for John McCain.''


   The governor has ``a limited amount of time, and we're just not
going to set aside right now a time to meet with (Log Cabin
leaders) and talk about their dialogue,'' Rove said.


   Besides his hate-crimes and anti-gay-adoption positions, Bush,
as governor, has refused to support gay marriages.


   Rove held out the possibility of a future meeting between the
group and Bush but said the candidate already enjoys support among
gays. ``We have gay Republican supporters and advisers who are
involved in the campaign and whom we meet with regularly,'' he
said.


   Kevin Ivers, spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the
nation's largest GOP homosexual group, called Rove's remarks ``very
disappointing.'' He added that ``his comments are not at all
reflective of the long and cordial relationship that we had with
him for months.''


   Rich Tafel, the group's executive director, said Bush ``has
created what has become a confrontational situation. We have now
heard five different reasons why they won't meet with us. Now it's
because we attack them. The campaign is saying, `We don't need to
hear your opinions. Get on board.'''


   The controversy began after Bush's response last month to a
question on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Asked whether he would meet
with the Log Cabin Republicans, Bush replied, ``Probably not.'' He
contended that such a meeting would create ``a huge political
scene,'' and added, ``I am someone who is a uniter, not a divider.
I don't believe in group thought, pitting one group of people
against another. And all that does is create kind of a huge
political, you know, nightmare for people.''


   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who also is seeking the Republican
presidential nomination, recently met with the Log Cabin
Republicans in Washington. Like Bush, McCain opposes gay marriage
and adoption and new hate-crime laws, but he told the group he
would battle discrimination against gays.


   Meanwhile, in other campaign matters, Rove said Bush will accept
federal matching funds for the general election, assuming he wins
the Republican presidential nomination. Under government campaign
spending rules, a candidate who accepts federal funds must abide by
spending limits.


   In explaining Bush's decision, Rove told reporters that ``it is
awfully difficult to raise $60 million or thereabouts between the
(political) convention and the Election Day and still campaign.''
He said Bush doesn't want to have to focus on fund-raising, but
would rather be out ``shaking hands.''


   During the long pre-primary season, Bush has raised an estimated
$70 million on his own, which has allowed him to forego federal
funds and spending limits.

   Rove also said that while Bush holds a commanding lead over the
five other Republican candidates in national polls, ``every month I
expect the numbers to tighten appreciably.''


   In fact, a new survey released Wednesday by the American
Research Group, a polling organization based in Manchester, N.H.,
shows McCain leading Bush in New Hampshire 37 percent to 30
percent.


   Rove said Bush could stumble in some of the nine major primaries
held early next year. In addition to New Hampshire, Rove said
McCain ``is competitive'' in his home state of Arizona.


   ``Somewhere along the line in one of those nine early states
there's going to be a rough patch or two in the road,'' Rove said.
``But we have built a campaign that is able to endure and win and
compete everywhere.''
