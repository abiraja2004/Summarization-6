   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republican presidential candidates are
creating an atmosphere that is subtly but fundamentally more
inviting to gay and lesbian voters than party leaders have been in
recent memory.


   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain and Elizabeth Dole _
who combined have the lion's share of support among Republicans in
early polls _ have signaled an openness to gay supporters,
including a willingness to appoint them to positions like
ambassadorships.


   The new receptivity toward homosexuality follows a similar
soft-pedaling by leading Republicans on abortion. While they still
oppose abortion and are by no means converts on other gay rights
issues like same-sex marriage, the most prominent candidates are
offering a lower-key, more inclusive approach designed to appeal
beyond the conservative base of the party to independent and
Democratic voters in a general election. It also reflects the
continued growing political influence of gay donors and gay voters
across party lines.


   The new message on gay supporters is a far cry from 1996, when
Republican nominee Bob Dole returned a $1,000 donation from the Log
Cabin Republicans, a group of gay party members, and from 1992,
when the dominant voice on the issue from Republicans was that of
Patrick Buchanan, whose declaration of a ``culture war'' was aimed
squarely at homosexuals.


   Buchanan and other conservative candidates have not changed
their views, and even Bush, McCain and Mrs. Dole have not embraced
a broader gay agenda that also includes adoptions by gays and a
less punitive approach toward gays in the military. But gay
political leaders say the difference in attitude is striking
nonetheless.


   ``The tone has totally changed,'' said Rich Tafel, executive
director of the Log Cabin Republicans. ``What I hear is gay
Republicans enthusiastic about the tone being set by the leading
candidates. It looks like Republicans for the first time are
saying, `This is a community I'm not going to alienate and maybe I
want to reach out to it.' That's kind of a shocking revelation.''

   Democrats, of course, have courted gay voters for years, and
this year both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley,
the two rivals for the Democratic nomination, are competing for
their support. Both campaigns have fund-raisers working expressly
with gay donors, who tend to be generous financially and active
politically.


   So intense is the Gore-Bradley rivalry for gay support that the
two candidates even appeared recently at the same gay and lesbian
community center in Los Angeles within a week of each other.


   On the Republican side, though, this rapprochement is new. Bush,
so far the run-away favorite in the Republican field, has said he
would have no qualms about hiring gays. ``If someone can do a job,
and a job that he's qualified for, that person ought to be allowed
to do his job,'' he said earlier this year.


   McCain, who has appointed Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only
openly gay Republican in the House, to his national steering
committee, has similarly said he would hire on merit alone. He has
supported anti-hate-crimes legislation that would protect victims
of crime not only because of their race but their ``sexual
orientation.'' He has said that someday he could envision a gay
president.


   Mrs. Dole has said she would appoint to her administration
anyone who was qualified, emphasizing in an NBC interview in July
that ``all people are welcome'' and adding: ``I'm inclusive.'' Of
the contribution that her husband spurned in 1996, Mrs. Dole said
that if she received a check from the same group, ``I would not
turn it away.''


   William Kristol, who was chief of staff to Vice President Dan
Quayle and now is editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, said
that the mainstream Republican candidates this year were clearly
unhappy under the banner of strident, anti-gay language.


   ``The Republican establishment does not want to fight the
conservative culture war,'' Kristol said, ``partly because they
think it's a losing fight, but more importantly, they don't believe
in it.''


   Outside the party establishment, Buchanan and other
conservatives remain adamant. His spokesman, Bob Adams, said
Buchanan ``has certainly not abandoned the culture war.'' Some,
like Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes, make their rejection of
homosexuality a major plank of their platforms. Bauer said recently
that when he heard McCain say the party should be ``a big tent that
admits everybody,'' the phrase sounded to him ``like fingernails on
a chalkboard.''


   Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher and candidate, flatly
opposes any concessions to gay voters. He frequently says he wants
``equal rights for all, special rights for none.'' Asked if Forbes
would appoint an openly gay person to his administration, his
campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said: ``If the person is qualified
for the job, that's fine as long as it is not a statement on a life
style or promoting a life style.'' As for gay adoptions, Dal Col
said: ``There are plenty of heterosexual couples out there,'' and
existing laws against hate crimes are enough.


   The Rev. Louis Sheldon, a staunch conservative who heads a
national group called the Traditional Values Coalition and who has
denounced homosexuals often in his career, denied that there was a
trend among Republicans to reach out to gay voters.


   Noting that the Republican presidential candidates oppose
homosexuals in the military and same-sex marriages, Sheldon said
that ``there aren't that many Log Cabin voters out there.'' He
added: ``There is nothing immutable about sexual behavior _ it is
chosen.''

   Still, anti-gay sentiment is less strident this year. Many
Republicans avoid the matter entirely. Brian Kennedy, the national
political director for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, said:
``He neither brings up those issues in his stump speech nor do we
ever recall him being asked about it. It doesn't seem to be on the
radar screen for the '99 cycle.'' Adams, Buchanan's spokesman,
agreed. ``It hasn't come up, and we haven't been making it an
issue,'' he said.


   Even Quayle, a social conservative who has aggressively promoted
``family values,'' has shown moderation toward homosexuals. Asked
on a radio program last month what he would do if one of his
children were homosexual, he said he would support them ``whatever
they are.''


   While he avoided answering specific questions about gays in the
military and gay adoptions, Quayle also said: ``Life-style
orientation really makes no difference to me at all. Believe me, I
don't inquire what one's sexual preference may or may not be.'' He
repeated his view that homosexuality is a choice but did not say,
as he did in 1992, that it was ``a wrong choice.''


   Kristol said that most Republicans were still being careful in
their statements because they did not want to alienate the
grass-roots conservatives who believe homosexuality is a sin. But
the candidates' tempered tone, he said, poses a dilemma for
conservative voters. ``The question is, do conservatives want to
win so badly that they will accept this kind of establishment
leadership?'' he asked. ``Or have they, too, given up on the
culture war? Do they want a political champion for their views?''


   Since gays emerged several years ago as a significant voting
bloc, Republicans ceded them to the Democrats. About 5 percent of
voters in 1996 identified themselves in polls of people leaving
voting booths as gay _ ``about the same percentage as Hispanics and
larger than the Jewish vote,'' said Elizabeth Birch, executive
director of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and
lesbian lobbying group.


   Tafel, who is organizing gay Republican voters this week to
participate in the Iowa straw poll and is seeking a slot for an
openly gay speaker at the Republican national convention next year,
said that the party was finally recognizing the influence of the
gay electorate. ``It's the first time we haven't been take for
granted'' as likely Democrats, he said. His group has yet to make
an endorsement or give any money to any of the presidential
candidates, but it plans to do so closer to next year's convention.


   Also making the gay vote more available to Republicans this year
is the fact that liberal Democrats have not been entirely happy
with the Clinton administration's record on gay issues. They have
complained of a lack of financing for the treatment of AIDS, the
opposition to gay marriage and the murky ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy that has allowed a record number of anti-gay discharges from
the military. Such discharges increased 86 percent over the last
five years.


   Alert to the potential appeal of Republicans who refrain from
broad cultural attacks, Democrats are warning that the Republicans
are not as tolerant as they may appear. Pat Ewing, a senior adviser
at the Democratic National Committee, said of Bush: ``He is
purposefully vague, not moderate. Bush denied Texans protection
from hate crimes and let it be known that he opposed any provision
to protect gays and lesbians from these crimes. His platitudes are
meant to obscure.''


   Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Bush, said he objected to the
hate-crimes legislation because ``all violent crime is motivated by
hate'' and Texas already has a law that covers such crimes. But,
she said, he also did not believe that sexual orientation should be
singled out for special rights. ``He doesn't believe in granting
legal rights based on sexual orientation,'' she said.


   Gore has made an extra effort to appeal to homosexuals. In one
of his rare departures from Clinton orthodoxy, he has called for a
more ``compassionate'' _ though unspecific _ approach to
homosexuals in the military.


   In California, which is likely to face a ballot initiative next
year that outlaws same-sex marriage, Gore said he favored legal
protections for same-sex partners, like health benefits and
hospital visitation rights, but he opposed ``a change in the
institution of marriage as we now know it between men and women.''


   He would leave gay adoptions up to adoption professionals on an
individual basis, his spokesman, Chris Lahane, said.


   Democrats acknowledge that Gore and Bradley have virtually
identical records on gay issues. Eric Hauser, a spokesman for
Bradley, said he supported a ``review'' of the ``don't ask, don't
tell'' policy on gays in the military. He also supports gay
adoptions and extending legal rights, including health benefits and
hospital visitation, to same-sex partners as ``common sense''
measures.


   When Bradley was in the Senate, he voted for the so-called
defense of marriage act, which said no state had to recognize the
same-sex laws of another state. Likewise, President Clinton signed
the bill into law, and Gore ``stood beside him'' in supporting it,
Ms. Birch said.


   Although Gore has been outspoken in favor of gay issues, he has
also been the target of gay demonstrators. AIDS activists have
cropped up, noisily, at several of his campaign events, accusing
him of siding with drug companies and trying to block South
Africa's access to cheaper generic drugs to fight HIV. His staff
says this is an international patent issue and is trying to work it
out.
