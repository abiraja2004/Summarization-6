   The leader of one of Texas's most conservative Christian groups
criticized national Republican party officials on Thursday for
inviting a homosexual congressman to speak at the GOP convention in
Philadelphia next week.


   A spokesman for Texas Gov. George Bush, who is expected to win
the presidential nomination at the convention, replied that Arizona
Rep. Jim Kolbe's sexual orientation has nothing to do with his
scheduled speech on free trade.


   Cathie Adams, president of the Eagle Forum of Texas and a member
of the national party's platform committee, said the decision to
invite Kolbe directly contradicts the ``pro-family'' plank of the
GOP platform, which does not uphold the rights of homosexuals.


   Adams stopped short of pulling her support from Bush, saying
``I'm not making any threats like that right now.''


   But, she said, ``this is a quota. ... This is being done to
pander to the homosexual agenda.''


   Kolbe is scheduled to address the convention about free trade
issues for three minutes on Tuesday night.


   According to the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay conservative
group, it will be the first time a homosexual man has spoken at the
GOP's national convention.


   Adams sent an e-mail to about 500 people on Thursday _ delegates
and others _ from Philadelphia, where she is meeting with the
platform committee in preparation for next week's convention.


   ``My heart is crying,'' Adams wrote. ``I need your prayers for a
response that proclaims God-fearing wisdom. ...


   ``It's hypocritical to have that plank, then invite an open
homosexual to address our convention just because he's
homosexual,'' she wrote, referring to the pro-family plank in the
GOP platform.


   A Kolbe spokeswoman said she had not seen the letter and
declined to comment.


   A Bush spokesman said the Congressman's sexual orientation ``is
not a factor.''


   ``We're pleased that he'll be talking about the importance of
free trade and opening markets to American products and
producers,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan.
``Congressman Kolbe is a leader in promoting and encouraging free
and fair trade.''


   State party leaders agreed, saying Kolbe's sexual orientation is
``a nonissue.''


   ``I would respectfully disagree'' with Adams' characterization,
said Texas state party spokesman Robert Black. ``It appears that
Congressman Kolbe has decided that the broad issues that all
Republicans agree upon is more important than his homoseuxal rights
agenda, and that's why he has decided to speak at the convention.''


   Bush was criticized by Christian groups earlier this year after
meeting with Log Cabin Republicans and saying he welcomed them in
his campaign.


   Adams suggested the party invite conservative Alan Keyes, who
lost his bid for the nomination early in the primary season, to
speak on moral issues ``to save face with all the families across
America.''


   ``The epitome of that ability as an orator on moral and social
issues is Alan Keyes,'' she said.


   Keyes spokeswoman Connie Hair said his phone lines were down at
his home and he could not be reached for comment.
