   Autism was believed to be solely a human condition,
characterized by a limited ability to communicate and a lack of
response to others. But it seems animals can be autistic too.


   Neurologists have bred long-haired albino guinea pigs with the
same neurological abnormalities seen in some autistic people. With
these defects in the cerebellum, the part of the brain responsible
for coordination, the guinea pigs developed behavioral traits
typical of autistic patients.


   The team, from the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris,
the University of Rouen and New York Medical College, placed one
altered guinea pig _ known as GS _ in a cage with a normal one and
compared their behavior and social interaction, such as sniffing,
licking and mating attempts.


   They found that the GS guinea pigs were much less inclined to
interact with the other animals, and showed a reluctance to explore
or respond to their surroundings _ all behavior that can be found
in autistic children (European Journal of Neuroscience, vol. 10, p.
2677).


   Jean Caston, a member of the team, says that an animal model for
autism could be useful to understand the condition better. &QL;
