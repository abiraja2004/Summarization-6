   DAM-FISH (Undated) _ A panel of scientists assembled by the
federal government says punching holes in four Snake River dams in
southeastern Washington is the best way to help endangered salmon
there. But that conclusion drew unmerciful fire in the region and
in the halls of Congress. So this week federal fisheries managers
will tell Pacific Northwesterners, in effect: ``OK, you figure out
what to do.'' They will offer a menu of other, equally unpleasant
alternatives that, among other things, have the potential to cause
a faceoff between Washington and Idaho over water rights.

   GORE-MICROSOFT (Undated) _ The vice president makes a visit to
Microsoft, weighing in on the federal court monopoly ruling and
other matters.

   AUTISM-SPECIAL (Undated) _ Special package: Autism is a
mysterious brain disorder that affects between 1 out of 500 and 1
out of 1,000 children. Scientists cannot agree on the incidence,
except to say it appears to be growing. No one knows exactly why.
But the rise is fueling an unprecedented concern over the best way
to help children with autism, as well as intensified research into
possible causes and cures.

   AUTISM-CURE (Undated) _ When news broke a few months ago that
Seattle would become one of two places in the country doing
federally funded research on an experimental treatment for autism,
the researchers were deluged with calls. Fifty-one slots. Four
hundred families.


   By Carol Smith. (Story will move in the ``a'' category.)


   AUTISM-CAUSE (Undated) _ The only thing more puzzling than
autism itself is why it appears to be on the rise. Grasping at
clues, researchers and parents have come up with a variety of
theories _ many of them at odds with one another. But so far, the
answer remains as inaccessible as the patients themselves.

   AUTISM-KIDS (Undated) _ On the outside, the Brestler house looks
like any number of gracious Eastside homes for a growing family
with three children. On the inside, it's a little different. But
it's not obvious at first. There are invisible alarms on all the
doors here, to keep children from wandering away. And what looks
like a well-appointed playroom is really a fully equipped
behavioral therapy center. The Brestlers have three boys. The two
youngest have autism.

   AUTISM-THERAPY (Undated) _ The explosion in the population of
children with autism has created huge demand for therapists who can
provide ``Applied Behavioral Analysis'' (ABA), the only widely
accepted treatment for autism.

   AUTISM-INFO (Undated) _ A list of agencies providing information
on autism.

   TV-BEST (Undated) _ Just to stay on top of the game,
conscientious TV critics _ and they all know who they are _ watch a
lot of stuff they don't necessarily like. This helps explain the
times they've had to tell loved ones they couldn't go out to Chez
Chimichanga for the free-range chicken burrito on a Friday night
because they had to stay home and watch ABC's TGIF lineup.

   FBN-VECSEY-COLUMN _ Laura Vecsey column on Seahawks defensive
star Cortez Kennedy.

   FBN-SEAHAWKS _ Joey Galloway is convinced he's the elite
receiver in the NFL. After watching his performance Sunday night
before a national television audience, his teammates agree.
Question is, does his coach?
