   AUTISM2 (Phoenix) _ Days after her first secretin injection last
year, Rebecca David slept until 7:30 a.m. It was a remarkable
development for a girl who for years had been rousing her parents
at 4 a.m. Rebecca's family, along with several dozen others in the
Valley, called the Southwest Autism Research Center in Phoenix with
the good news: Their autistic children were sleeping better, eating
better, communicating more easily. The parents attributed the
differences to secretin, a drug they hoped would help free their
children from &UR; autism, a developmental disorder that has baffled
researchers for 50 years. There was only one problem: Almost all
the 30 Phoenix-area children in the yearlong clinical trial of
secretin reported great results _ even though a third had received
a placebo. By JODIE SNYDER. Story will move in the ``A'' category.
