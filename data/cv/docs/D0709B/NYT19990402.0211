   &UR; YOU BLINKED AND IT PASSED YOU BY &LR;


   Movers and shakers and writers and editors at the Freedom
Forum's Newseum in Arlington, Va., have come up with a list of the
100 least significant news stories of the century. It should be
noted that most of them _ being easily forgettable _ are from the
last quarter of the 20th century. Personals' favorite 10:


   1) Millennium mania. 1999.


   2)  &UR; Yakov Smirnoff &LR;  immigrates to America. 1978.


   3)  &UR; LeRoy Neiman &LR; 's ``Olympics'' period. 1972.


   4) Wiffle Ball. 1953.


   5) World War II temporarily disrupts production of porcelain
pixie Hummel figurines. 1942.


   6) Panda diplomacy. 1972.


   7) Admiral  &UR; James Stockdale  &LR; asks ``Who am I?'' _ thus
redefining vice presidential debating technique. 1992.


   8) Supermodels enter restaurant business. 1995.


   9) Menudo-mania. 1984.


   10) Founding of National Hacky Sack Association. 1978.


   &UR; WHAT HARM CAN IT DO? &LR;


   A female reader forwards a Wall Street Journal story about a
recent FDA report on possible side effects of Viagra:


   ``Abnormal hair growth, speech disorder, amnesia, loss of
libido, hallucination, anorexia, tinnitus, skin discoloration,
hiccups, sleepwalking, eye-rolling hostility, euphoric mood, dry
mouth, agitation, confusion, insomnia, abnormal thinking, abnormal
skin odor, depression, increased sweating, flatulence, abnormal
dreams and belching.''


   ``Small price to pay!'' writes the sister.


   P.S. In other accounts of masculine hardships, cosmetic
dermatologist  &UR; Seth Matarasso &LR;  told San Francisco magazine that
male lawyers are using Botox to paralyze facial muscles so that
their faces won't reveal their emotions.


   &UR; FLASH &LR;


   - A court in Germany ruled that &UR; Katarina Witt &LR;  is a public
figure and, therefore, a Frankfurt newspaper could legally reprint
a photograph of her ice skating nude. Witt had posed for the photo,
which appeared first in Playboy magazine.


   &UR; - Norm Macdonald &LR; , interviewed just before his sitcom's debut,
in the latest Rolling Stone, said that he agreed to live in Los
Angeles only to be near his 6-year-old son (he is separated from
his wife).


   ``Los Angeles is all show-business people,'' said Macdonald.
``It's cool seeing celebrities from the old days, but there are
less and less of them. I only like guys that were famous before I
got into show business _ everyone else is, like, so what?''


   - The Sony Pictures film remake of ``Charlie's Angels'' will
star &UR; Drew Barrymore &LR; , &UR; Cameron Diaz  &LR; and  &UR; Angelina Jolie &LR; , says the
BBC. The grandes dames of the series _ &UR; Farrah Fawcett &LR; ,  &UR; Kate &LR; 
 &UR; Jackson &LR;  and  &UR; Jaclyn Smith &LR;  _ are said to have been asked to make
cameo appearances.


   - Was it an April Fool's joke, wonders  &UR; Jacki Bernier &LR; , that
that day's issue of the Berkeley Voice carried the banner notice:
``Daylight Savings: Don't forget to set clocks back an hour
Sunday''?


   - More than 25 years ago,  &UR; Jessica Mitford &LR; 's muckraking
magazine story about the Famous Writers School closed down that
institution. Now,  &UR; Bob Treuhaft &LR; , Mitford's widower, is pleased to
report that in February, a year after Vanity Fair posthumously
published her essay raking the funeral conglomerate Service Corp.
Inc., the value of that company's shares had dropped by two-thirds.
She would have wanted it that way.


   - Actress and literary critic  &UR; Christina Ricci &LR;  told Teen People
magazine that her favorite book is  &UR; Ayn Rand &LR; 's ``The
Fountainhead.'' ``It's really interesting how she romanticizes a
way of dealing with emotions and people that's so different than
what we're given in films and stuff.''


   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;


   &UR; ``Having your portrait painted is a strange experience. At the &LR; 
 &UR; same time, to anyone who has served in Washington, there is &LR; 
 &UR; something oddly familiar about it. First, you are painted into a &LR; 
 &UR; corner. Then you are hung out to dry. And finally, you are &LR; 
 &UR; framed.'' &LR;


   - Former Secretary of State  &UR; Warren Christopher &LR;  at the
unveiling of his portrait in the State Department last week.
