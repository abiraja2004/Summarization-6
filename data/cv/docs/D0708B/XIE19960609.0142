HANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang province
will spend 7.1 billion yuan on building water supply projects to
meet the urban needs in the coming five years.


A provincial official said that the water shortage caused the
province's industrial output value to decrease by 3.6 billion yuan
last year, and people in a number of cities and counties are
short of drinking water supply.


The official said that the main reason for the water shortage
was inadequate government investment in building water supply
projects.


While increasing funds in constructing more water supply
facilities, the provincial government has decided to raise funds
through different channels including overseas investment for such
undertakings.
