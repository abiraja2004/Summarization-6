   INTERNATIONAL


   ELIAN _ MIAMI _ Both sides in the Elian Gonzales case remained
defiant Friday as they awaited the decision of a federal appeals
court on whether the 6-year-old Cuban rafter must be transferred to
the custodianship of his father. Large crowds remained outside the
Little Havana home where the boy is staying with relatives. But in
Washington, there were indications the government's patience is
wearing thin. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner said the relatives are ``not in
compliance with the law'' and vowed the feds will take
``appropriate'' action ``when we're ready.'' (MWilliams, Cox News
Service). 30.

   PRIVATE-PRISONS _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla., _ With a state prison

contemplating what will happen if private prison companies start

of the country's inmate population in Florida, though they do own
vacant land. (Bierman, Palm Beach Post). MOVED THURSDAY.
