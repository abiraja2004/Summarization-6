BRUSSELS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian naval officer
said here Thursday that the 118 sailors on board the stricken
Kursk submarine could survive for two more weeks before their
oxygen runs out.


Russia's Naval Vice Chief of Staff Alexander Pobozhy, head of a
visiting Russian delegation, told a meeting of NATO delegates that
in an incident some years ago when a Soviet submarine sank,
survivors were found after three weeks.


"From our experience with the Soviet submarine forces, it can
be as long as two to three weeks," he said.


Russian and NATO officials held a four-hour meeting at the NATO
headquarters in Brussels to discuss what kind of assistance the
western alliance could offer to help save the 118 crew of a
nuclear submarine trapped on the bed of the Barents Sea.


The 14,000-ton Kursk has been stranded about 107 meters below
the Barents Sea since last Saturday after a major disaster --
thought to have been caused by a collision or an explosion.


Russian rescue efforts have failed so far and Russia has
accepted offers of help from Britain and Norway on Wednesday.


Currently, Britain and Norway are sending personnel to the
accident site. A British rescue submarine and back-up staff were
flown to Norway Wednesday en route to the tragic spot. Norway said
it would send up to 15 divers from its offshore oil and gas
industry.


But the rescue submarine and divers are not expected to be in
the position until Saturday.


NATO officials said further offers of help could involve rescue
equipment and equipment to deal with the medical aftermath, such
as decompression chambers.


World reaction showed that hopes of finding any of the Kursk
crew alive are fading after tapped SOS signals stopped on Tuesday.


NATO officials said Thursday's meeting between Russians and
NATO delegates in Brussels include a telephone link-up with
British submarine rescue experts in Morthwood, England, and a
wider discussion about the angle at which the Kursk was lying on
the seabed, the water and the weather conditions, and other
organizational and technical matters.
