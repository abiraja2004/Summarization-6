BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow will mark the start of
hard times for more than two million smokers in the Chinese
capital, when public places just say "no" to smoking tomorrow.


A local smoking ban will go into effect tomorrow, and "No
smoking" signs and admonitory slogans will be seen on major
streets, at busy shopping areas, and in public places in Beijing.


Some 80,000 people will go to the areas to enforce the ban
tomorrow, stopping and fining offenders.


The ban was passed by the Municipal People's Congress, the
local legislative body, last December, and has gained wide
support, although half the adult males are still smoking, and the
number of women and teenagers who puff is on the rise.


A massive publicity campaign backed by media coverage was begun
several years ago to make people aware of the adverse effects of
smoking and to encourage them to stop.


Of course, chewing gum companies have been eager to take the
opportunity to cash in, collecting money that used to be used to
support the habit.


Different types of gum began appearing and being heavily
advertised in recent times, selling themselves as "good
companions" to those who want to kick the habit.


A recent survey of 9,408 citizens found that about 94 percent
endorsed the ban, because they believe that smoking not only harms
smokers' health but also that of people nearby.


Officials, government employees, medical personnel, and
teachers have taken the lead in the fight against smoking,
according to the Beijing Patriotic Public Health Campaign
Committee, headquarters of the anti-smoking drive, and about 500
schools, hospitals, department stores, and other units have
adopted measures to become "smoke-free units", according to the
committee.
