   WASHINGTON _ Despite high-profile shootings at schools around
the country in the past year, such violence has remained steady
since 1992 and the world inside the classroom remains a relatively
safe place, a report being released Wednesday concludes.


   The Justice Policy Institute (JPI), a liberal criminal justice
think tank with offices in Washington and San Francisco, said a
media-driven public fear about school violence is ``overblown.''


   The institute's report charged that policymakers in Washington
and in state legislatures have overreacted to a crisis that does
not exist and are engaged in a ``tragic misdirection of attention
and resources.''


   JPI's Jason Ziedenberg, co-author of the study, said, ``Juvenile
violence is a real problem in society, but if you really want to
track it down, you're looking wrong place. School is about as safe
a place as you can put your kids.''


   There were 40 shooting deaths in schools in the 1997-1998 school
year, the report said. A year earlier there were 25. But In the
1992-1993 school year, 55 shooting deaths occurred. In 1993-1994
there were 51, followed by 20 in 1994-1995 and 35 in 1995-1996.


   Although the number of school deaths jumped 60 percent last year
over the year before, Zeidenberg called the increase
``statistically insignificant'' because of the numbers in 1992-1993
and 1993-1994.


   The report relied on data from the U.S. Education Department,
the Justice Department, the FBI, nongovernment groups that track
school violence and newspaper clippings. It defined deadly school
violence as killings of adults as well as children on school
property.


   For instance, it counted the May 1998 shooting of a speech
diagnostician by her jealous boyfriend at Stranahan High School in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.


   Concern over school violence reached its apogee in March when
two boys, aged 13 and 11, opened fire on a crowd of children and
teachers in Jonesboro, Ark. Four students and one teacher died in
the hail of bullets. Similar incidents during the 1997-1998 school
year occurred in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.;
and Springfield, Ore.


   Many news outlets referred to each shooting as ``an
all-too-familiar story'' or ``another in a recent trend,'' the JPI
report said. Members of Congress and other officials ``reacted
abruptly to what they perceived to be a huge swing in public
opinion,'' the report continued, adding: ``A moral panic swept the
country.''


   President Clinton has endorsed pending legislation to increase
the number of police officers available to deal with juvenile
crime. Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, a Republican, suggested
reducing the number of nighttime scholastic sporting events and
after-school programs as a way of lowering the chance of violence.


   Local school administrators also reacted. Two elementary school
students in Tyrone, Ga., were temporarily suspended for pinpointing
those they wanted to do away with, a list that included Barney the
purple dinosaur and the British singing group, Spice Girls.


   The report called all these reactions ``overblown.'' It said
that ``everyday gun violence'' against children is a far more
pressing concern. More than 3,000 children a year die from gunfire,
said the report, quoting figures from the U.S. National Center for
Health Statistics. Children are killed in gun accidents at 23 times
the rate they are killed in schools, the report said.


   The relatively flat trend-line noted in the report appeared to
be in line with data from other sources. The FBI, for instance,
reported there were 25 homicides committed by juveniles under 13 in
1965 and 16 in 1996.


   In a two-year study between 1992 and 1994, the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention found that students had less
than a one in a million chance of dying violently in school. By
contrast, the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Program in 1997 calculated that overall, for every
million juveniles, 38 were murdered that year. That's 40 times the
rate for deaths in schools, the JPI report said.


   The institute's study encouraged continuation of after-school
programs as a way of ``productively occupying'' children. It also
recommended gun restrictions, including the ``one-gun-a-month''
laws that limit the quantities of guns an individual can purchase.


   Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the conservative Criminal
Justice Legal Foundation in Sacramento, Calif., said the flat
school violence trendline noted in the report ``doesn't mean a
whole lot.''


   Although down overall in recent years, crime and violence in and
out of school remains significantly higher than it was 40 years
ago, he said.
