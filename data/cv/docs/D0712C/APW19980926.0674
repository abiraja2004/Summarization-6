	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Islamic groups said
Saturday that they were outraged that Iran had softened its stand
toward British writer Salman Rushdie.
	   While stopping short of revoking a death sentence against
Rushdie, Iran says it won't adopt any measures that threaten his
life, or anyone connected to his book -- The Satanic Verses. Nor
will Iran encourage or help anyone to do so.
