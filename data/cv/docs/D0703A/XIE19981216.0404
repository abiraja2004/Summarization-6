BUCHAREST, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian banking system
is ready to perform services in the European single currency, the
euro, the Rompres news agency reported on Tuesday citing sources
from Romania's Central Bank.


"Romania's Central Bank (BNR) and the country's commercial
banks fear little about the introduction of the euro and will
easily adapt to it," BNR Foreign Currency Director George
Mucibabici told a recent colloquium on euro in Bucharest.


BNR and Romanian commercial banks that want to perform euro
services will have to open accounts in euro by January 4, 1999,
the first scheduled day of euro use, and inform their foreign
partners. BNR indicative exchange rates will be modified to
include euro instead of the current European single currency, the
ECU.
