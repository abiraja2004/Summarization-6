   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Sitting at their students' desks two days before
the start of the new school year, four high school biology teachers
here were hashing over the vote of the Kansas Board of Education,
earlier this month, to delete virtually any mention of evolution
from the state's recommended science curriculum and its
standardized tests.


   The teachers' reaction was as swift as it was unanimous: They
would continue to teach science as they have been, with the support
of their superintendent.


   ``They'll get evolution here,'' said Elaine Pardee, who teaches
at Washburn Rural High, where the science classroom walls are lined
with various animal skeletons that, by their very appearance,
testify to the evolutionary theory of a common ancestor among
mammals. ``We're not going to cheat our kids.''


   About 200 miles away in Pratt, a small town west of Wichita, the
local school board president, Willa Beth Mills, had a very
different reaction to the state board's action. She applauded it,
and said she hoped that it would lead to elements of creationism _
or at least a heavy dose of skepticism about the theory of
evolution _ being injected into her district's schools.


   ``I don't think it's relegated to Sunday school,'' Mrs. Mills
said. ``If you present the material to students with critical
thinking, and they come to you with a paper supporting creationism,
or arguing against evolutionary theory from a creationist point of
view, you should accept that.''


   These are emotionally volatile and exceptionally confusing days
for the teachers, principals and parents of Kansas' public school
children. Two weeks after the board's vote, which was widely
interpreted as establishing an important national beachhead for
creationists, the theater of battle has shifted to the state's 304
public school districts.


   Because the adoption of standards in science or any other
subject cannot be dictated under state law, it will be up to each
district to decide whether to follow the lead of the state board,
which periodically issues guidelines suggesting what should be
taught in the state's classrooms. What the state board can control
is the content of its standardized tests.


   Beginning in the 2000-2001 school year, the state tests in 7th-
and 10th-grade science will not ask students questions about the
theories that multiple species have evolved from a common ancestor
and that the universe originated in an explosion, or big bang _ two
ideas that have come under sharp attack from those who have found
more persuasive evidence of the world's origins in religion.
Questions about ``micro-evolution,'' defined in the state
guidelines as changes in an organism's ``structure, function or
behavior,'' will remain.


   At issue for Kansans is nothing less than reconciling two
central explanations of life: the Darwinian theory that man and
monkey gradually branched off from the same family tree millions of
years ago as they adjusted to a changing environment, a contention
heavily rooted in scientific evidence, and the creationist belief
that a divine being has been pulling the biological levers of the
universe, including the origin of man as described in the Bible.


   The debate concerns more than what public school students should
learn about each point of view, more than a decade after the
Supreme Court said states could not compel the teaching of
creationism. For science teachers, the state board's
characterization of evolution as a theory shrouded in doubt _ no
matter the supporting testimony of fossils and genetic codes _ has
raised worries about whether other theories at the heart of
science, like those concerning atoms or even gravity, will come
under attack next.

   ``If you take away evolution because it's a theory, you can't
teach science,'' said Steve Angel, a chemistry professor who is the
president of the Auburn-Washburn school board in Topeka and a
member of the committee of experts whose standards were rewritten
by the state board. ``All of science is theory.''


   Gov. Bill Graves, a moderate Republican, has been among the most
vocal critics of the state board, whose 10 members are elected and
are outside of his control. He argues that the six-member majority
that rewrote the standards in just a few hours, ripping out whole
pages of a document that had been drafted over nearly two years by
a committee of 27 scientists and science teachers, did so to make a
rhetorical splash at the behest of the conservative wing of the
state Republican Party.


   ``There are 304 locally elected school boards who have the
option to tell the state board to go jump in the lake,'' said Mike
Matson, a spokesman for the governor. ``The governor is confident
the overwhelming number will.''

   At the urging of a group of parents, the school board in Pratt,
a town of about 7,000, arranged a presentation earlier this month
from a local wildlife biologist about a controversial book titled
``Of Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological
Origins.'' The book _ first printed in 1989 by Haughton Publishing
of Dallas and since sold to public schools in more than a dozen
states, including Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Texas _ suggests that
``intelligent design,'' as engineered by an ``intelligent agent,''
may be a more compelling explanation than biological evolution for
the wide variety found in nature.


   While the book stops well short of identifying God as the
designer, as creationists might, critics, including those
affiliated with the National Association of Biology Teachers, have
condemned the book as little more than an artfully worded end-run
around the constitutional separation of church and state in the
classroom.


   But to Chris Mammoliti, a biologist with the state Department of
Wildlife and Parks who presented the book to the Pratt board, ``Of
Pandas and People'' and its theory of intelligent design provides
the perfect antidote to those teachers who might be tempted to
teach evolution as an undisputed fact.


   ``I see the theory as saying, `It is legitimate to have, as part
of the tool kit for science education, the option to say that the
things we see in nature may be designed or could have been
designed,''' he said. ``It doesn't speculate or presuppose that
there is a creator or miracles involved.''


   Mrs. Mills, the board president in Pratt, said the book is now
under consideration for inclusion as a supplement to the district
science curriculum, which was already being rewritten at the time
of the state board vote.

   Administrators in Pratt said that Mrs. Mills' position on the
standards has not prompted anyone to tell district officials they
would pull their children out of the school system.


   In Auburn-Washburn, one of five school districts in Topeka, the
board president, Steve Angel, and the superintendent, Howard
Shuler, have pledged that there will be no change in the district
science standards in response to the state board vote. Shuler said
that only one parent of the district's 5,000 students had written
to criticize the district stance, and that none had threatened to
pull children out of district schools.)


   Ninth-grade biology students at Washburn Rural will be
introduced to Darwin and the theory of evolution over three to five
days in the spring semester, after they have gone through rites of
high school biology like dissecting a rat and a sheep's heart.


   The textbook used in the ninth grade, ``Biology: Visualizing
Life,'' published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston of Austin, Texas,
explains that ``monkeys, apes and humans are examples of primates''
and argues that ``primates most likely evolved from small,
insect-eating rodentlike mammals that lived about 60 millions years
ago.''


   Ms. Pardee, who has taught biology at Washburn Rural for nine
years, tells her students that the theory of evolution ``is the
most currently acceptable scientific explanation that we have,''
but adds that her students ``don't have to believe it.'' What she
insists is that her students ``know what the facts of the theory
are.'' Though they might be able to pass the new state science test
without such knowledge, she says, the material is covered in the
standardized science test for the district and the advanced
placement test in biology.


   When the inevitable question from a student arises about
creationism, usually couched in a biblical reference, Kevin
Bordewick, another biology teacher at Washburn Rural, said he cuts
off such discussions, believing they are better suited to a
humanities class or the home. ``It's between them, their parents
and whatever God they believe in, if any,'' Bordewick said.


   Though Bordewick and his colleagues at Washburn said they would
never introduce their personal beliefs into the classroom, other
teachers said drawing such a thick line was nearly impossible.


   Joyce Depenbusch, who teaches 7th- and 8th-grade science in
Skyline, in Pratt County, says she believes that ``evolution and
creation don't have to be mutually exclusive,'' and that ``God's
plan of creation can include evolution.''


   While Mrs. Depenbusch says she does not ``present the science of
creationism in my classroom,'' she says she was not opposed to
telling her students about her beliefs, as long as she prefaced her
comments ``very heavily'' with a warning that the ideas were her
own.


   ``Evolution is a theory,'' she said. ``We can present several
different theories to help them think. Let them do some thinking
with the help of their families. Then let them make up their own
minds.''
